## h5p-misc-math-001
[h5p-misc-math-001](https://github.com/justineuro/h5p-misc-math-001) is an implementation of [h5p-standalone](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone).  More information on H5P may be found at [https://h5p.org](https://h5p.org).

The file [`misc-math-001-10.html`](./misc-math-001-10.html) (see the H5P rendered [here](https://justineuro.github.io/h5p-misc-math-001/misc-math-001-10.html)) contains a simple H5P that uses the [Question Set H5P template](https://h5p.org/question-set) to generate a set of 10 single-choice multiple-choice questions in math (from a pool of 30 questions).  
  
This folder includes (among others):  
  
* [`misc-math-001-15.html`](./misc-math-001-10.html) - an HTML file that contains the javascript code for rendering the H5P.
* [`dist`](./dist) - a folder from the [h5p-standalone](https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone) distribution that contains the essential files that allow the H5P content to be rendered in a standalone HTML page (i.e., independent of a platform such as certain Learning Management System (LMS)).
